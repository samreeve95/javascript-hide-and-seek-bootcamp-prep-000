/*
- Define a function `getFirstSelector(selector)`, which accepts a selector and
  returns the first element that matches.
- Define a function `nestedTarget()` that pulls a `.target` out of `#nested`
  (`#` is used for IDs in selectors â€” but you knew that because you [read the docs][docs],
  right? :) ). (Note that in `index.html` `#nested` and `.target` just
  _happen_ to be `div`s. This method should work with arbitrary elements.)
- Define a function `increaseRankBy(n)` that increases the ranks in all of the
  `.ranked-list`s by `n`. (You might need to make use of [`parseInt()`][parseint]
- Define a function `deepestChild()` that pulls out the most deeply nested child
  element from `div#grand-node`. (Remember, you can iterate over elements and call
  `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` on them. This is challenging to
  implement correctly, but not beyond your ability!)
